Here's a complete lab with all necessary details for a new learner to get started with AWS Glue:

## AWS Glue Beginner's Lab: Building a Simple ETL Pipeline

### Objective
In this lab, you'll create a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS Glue to convert CSV data to Parquet format.

### Prerequisites
- An AWS account with administrator access
- Basic understanding of AWS services
- Familiarity with Python (helpful but not required)

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Ensure you're in your preferred region (e.g., us-east-1).

### Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket

1. Navigate to Amazon S3 in the AWS Console.
2. Click "Create bucket".
3. Name your bucket (e.g., "glue-lab-yourinitials-input").
4. Leave other settings as default and click "Create bucket".
5. Create another bucket for output (e.g., "glue-lab-yourinitials-output").

### Step 3: Upload Sample Data

1. Download a sample CSV file (e.g., customer data) from a public source or create your own.
2. Upload this CSV file to your input S3 bucket.

### Step 4: Create an IAM Role for Glue

1. Go to IAM in the AWS Console.
2. Click "Roles" > "Create role".
3. Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity and "Glue" as the use case.
4. Attach these policies:
   - AWSGlueServiceRole
   - AmazonS3FullAccess
5. Name the role (e.g., "GlueLab-Role") and create it.

### Step 5: Create a Glue Crawler

1. Navigate to AWS Glue in the console.
2. Go to "Crawlers" and click "Create crawler".
3. Name your crawler (e.g., "CSV-Customer-Crawler").
4. Choose "S3" as the data source and specify your input bucket path.
5. Select the IAM role you created.
6. Create a new database (e.g., "customerdb").
7. Complete the crawler creation.

### Step 6: Run the Crawler

1. Select your crawler and click "Run crawler".
2. Wait for the crawler to finish. It will create a table in the Glue Data Catalog.

### Step 7: Create a Glue ETL Job

1. In AWS Glue, go to "ETL Jobs" and click "Create job".
2. Choose "Author code with a script editor" and "Spark" as the Engine  and name your job (e.g., "CSV-to-Parquet").
3. Select the IAM role you created earlier.
4. In the script editor, paste the following code:

```python
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])

sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session
job = Job(glueContext)
job.init(args['JOB_NAME'], args)

# Read input data
datasource = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(
    database="customerdb",
    table_name="your_table_name"
)

# Convert to Parquet and write to S3
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    frame = datasource,
    connection_type = "s3",
    connection_options = {"path": "s3://{your-initial-bucket-name}/customer-parquet/"},
    format = "parquet",
    format_options={"compression": "snappy"}
)


job.commit()
```

5. Replace "your_table_name" with the actual table name created by your crawler under AWS Glue>Tables (left panel-> Data Catalog-> Tables).
6. Replace the bucket name with the name of the s3 bucket you created initially.
7. Save and create the job.

### Step 8: Run the ETL Job

1. Select your job and click "Run job".
2. Monitor the job progress in the Glue console.

### Step 9: Verify the Results

1. Once the job completes, go to your output S3 bucket.
2. You should see Parquet files in the specified folder.

### Step 10: Clean Up

To avoid unnecessary charges:
1. Delete both S3 buckets.
2. Delete the Glue database, crawler, and job.
3. Delete the IAM role.

### Conclusion

You've successfully created an ETL pipeline using AWS Glue to convert CSV data to Parquet format. This lab introduced you to key AWS Glue concepts including crawlers, the Data Catalog, and ETL jobs.
